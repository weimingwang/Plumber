# Plumber

This is a javascript based 2D game I developed as a hobby in 2015. At that time, I was really into javascript. How time flies!

This game mimics Nintendo's famous Super Mario game. (Hats off all the people behind it). And only as for academic, research and coding practices purposes.

And special thanks to CraftyJS which make gaming on javascript so easy!
